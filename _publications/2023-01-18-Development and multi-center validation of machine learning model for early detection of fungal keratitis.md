excerpt: 'Fungal keratitis (FK) is a leading cause of corneal blindness in developing countries due to poor clinical recognition and laboratory identification. Here, we aimed to identify the distinct clinical signature of FK and develop a diagnostic model to differentiate FK from other types of infectious keratitis.Our model enables rapid identification of FK, which will help ophthalmologists to establish a preliminary diagnosis and to improve the diagnostic accuracy in clinic.'
