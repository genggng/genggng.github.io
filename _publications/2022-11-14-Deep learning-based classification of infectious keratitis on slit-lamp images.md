excerpt: 'Infectious keratitis (IK) is an ocular emergency caused by a variety of microorganisms, including bacteria, fungi, viruses, and parasites. Culture-based methods were the gold standard for diagnosing IK, but difficult biopsy, delaying report, and low positive rate limited their clinical application. This study aims to construct a deep-learning-based auxiliary diagnostic model for early IK diagnosis. KeratitisNet demonstrates a good performance on clinical IK diagnosis and classification. Deep learning could provide an auxiliary diagnostic method to help clinicians suspect IK using different corneal manifestations.'
