excerpt: 'There are problems with the schemes in open electric power scenes, e.g., only able to detect single category, low detection accuracy of multi-scale objects, and difficulty in deploying models on mobile devices. To address the challenges mentioned above, we propose an object detection model, named PowerDet. It is able to detect 9 different types of power facilities efficiently with low cost.'
